//Full theory;
//Javascript execution context: that means how the file runs behind the mechine:
//There is one global execution context creates:(Thre is the different EC in all the Enverinment of the JS)
//We have thys type of context into our browser:
//1:-Global Execution context and functional execution and EVAL EC
//Java runs into 2 face:
//1:Memory creation face:(Creation face also)
//2:Excutin face :(All the operation done in this face:)
/*
let v1=5;
let v2=7;
function add(num1,num2){
    return num1+num2;
}
let ans=add(v1,v2);

step behind the mcode:

step 1:Global Exeuction:
First the GE is going to allocate with the This keyword:

step 2:Memory face:
Wee have to collect all the variable in one banch:
And assign all the variable with the undefine:

v1=UD
v2=UD
And in the name of function it store all the defination of the function:
ans=UD;

And this is the First Cycle;


Step3:
Excution face:
v1=value:
v2=value:
AND at the calling of the function the compiler creates the one EC (Which is called the new Excutional context)
And in the container there is create one Enverinmernt for the variable and the Execution threat
And then again the 2 steps will happen 
And this New created contex is going to return the variable in the global context:
